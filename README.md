# Shaders for Unity
This project contains various implementations of several different kinds of shaders in Unity.
My main objective as of now is to try and recreate several art styles (from films, games, and all other forms of art) using these shaders, which can be then used to make catchy and impressive visuals.
Thus, until I make a few really good shaders, I'll keep updating this repository with results (and hlsl or shader graph files). 

### Custom Toon shader with multiple bands (HLSL):

### Postprocessing Outlines & Diffusion based Dithering (Shader Graph):

↑ Procedural simple noise texture

## ScreenSpace Textures & Custom Light Implementation Shaders, with better URP Outline Implementation:

- The 3D scene now looks very unique, and a complete project in this style is bound to stand out, visually. As of now I'll try to create better shaders, and implement more complex aesthetics.
- I will soon upload the entire Unity project, with an organised Implementation of my showcase scene of the best shaders so far.
