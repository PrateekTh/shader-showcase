# Shaders for Unity
This project contains various implementations of several different kinds of shaders in Unity. I am learning, and eventually I'll add a unity project in this repository containing all the shaders I create, to turn this into a better showcase. 

My main objective as of now is to try and recreate several art styles (from films, games, and all other forms of art) using these shaders, which can be then used to make catchy and impressive visuals.
Thus, until I make a few really good shaders, I'll keep updating this repository with results (and hlsl or shader graph files).
